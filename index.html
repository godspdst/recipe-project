        <br>
        From Bon Appetit's archives, these just <em>might</em> be the <i>best</i> chocolate chip cookies you've ever eaten.
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups plus 1 Tbsp. (200 g) all-purpose flour (spooning into measuring cups, then leveling)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 tsp. (4 g) Diamond Crystal or 3/4 tsp. (4 g) Morton kosher salt</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp. (4 g) baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks; 169 g) unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup (200 g) (packed) dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50 g) grandulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
            <li>6 oz. (170 g) bittersweet chocolate (60%-70% cacao), coarsley chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°. Whisk <b>1 1/2 cups plus 1 Tbsp. (200 g) all-purpose flour</b>, <b>1 1/4 tsp. (4 g) Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. (4 g) Morton kosher salt</b>, and <b>3/4 tsp. (4 g) baking soda</b> in a small bowl; set flour mixture aside.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Cook <b>1/2 cup (1 stick; 113 g) unsalted butter</b> in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often and scraping bottom of pan with a heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams, then browns, about 4 minutes. Scrape melted butter and any brown bits to a large heatproof mixing bowl and let cool 1 minute. Cut remaining <b>1/4 cup (1/2 stick; 56 g) unsalted butter</b> into small pieces and add to brown butter (it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding the rest).</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Once butter is melted, add <b>1 cup (200 g) (packed) dark brown sugar</b> and <b>1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar</b> and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain. Add <b>1 large egg and 2 large egg yolks</b> and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Whisk in <b>2 tsp. vanilla extract</b>. Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in <b>6 oz. (170 g) bittersweet chocolate (60%–70% cacao), coarsely chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips</b> (the cookie dough will be soft but should hold its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back together several times and let rest 5–10 minutes until scoops hold their shape as the flour hydrates).</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Using a 1 1/2-oz. scoop (3 Tbsp.), portion out 16 balls of dough and divide between 2 parchment-paper-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies are browning very unevenly (otherwise, just leave them alone), until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, 8–10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.</p>
        <p><b>Do ahead:</b> Dough balls can be portioned 3 months ahead; freeze on cookie sheets and then transfer to a resealable plastic bag. Bake from frozen, adding 1-2 minutes on to the cook time. Cookies can be baked 3 days ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.</p>

        After all those cookies, you're gonna need something a little healthier.
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 head broccoli, florets and stems sliced into long, elegant strips</li>
            <li>1 bag frozen peas (optional)</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 lemon</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, finely grated</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Add the <b>broccoli</b> to a pot of boiling, salted water (if you’ve just made pasta, add the broccoli to the same pot after you’ve strained your pasta out). Blanch until the broccoli turns a bright, neon green, about 30 seconds. If you’re adding frozen peas, add them now and cook for another 30 seconds. Strain and transfer to a plate.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Squeeze some <b>lemon juice</b> and grate <b>garlic</b> over everything, giving it a toss to combine. Taste a spear—it should be tangy, salty, garlicky, not unlike an aggressive salad. Season with <b>flaky salt and freshly ground black pepper.</b></p>

        <br>
        The perfect meal for a gathering.
        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 large or 4 small oinions (12-16 oz.), diced</li>
            <li>8-10 cloves garlic, thinly sliced, plus 1 clove garlic, grated</li>
            <li>1/2-1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>1 (28 oz.) can whole peeled tomatoes, packed in juice</li>
            <li>1 (28 oz.) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup (8 oz.) ricotta</li>
            <li>2 tbs. heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 lb. large pasta shells</li>
            <li>1/2 lb. salted mozzarella, roughly torn by hand or grated</li>
            <li>Parmesan, for grating</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Make the tomato sauce: Heat <b>oil</b> in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add <b>onion and garlic</b> and season with <b>salt and pepper</b>. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is totally softened and translucent (without letting it brown, turning down the heat if needed), 8 to 10 minutes. Crush the <b>whole tomatoes</b> by hand and add them (including the <b>juice</b>) and the <b>crushed tomatoes</b> to the pot, stirring to scrape up any bits from the bottom of the pot. Fill the empty can about halfway with water, swirling to get any excess crushed tomatoes hanging around, and add it to the sauce. Season with <b>salt and pepper and add red pepper flakes</b>, if using. Bring to a simmer, then reduce to medium-low (or low, depending on your stove) and cook, stirring occasionally, letting it bubble gently, until the tomato sauce has thickened and flavors have come together, at least 30 minutes, and up to an hour and a half.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Make the cheese mixture: In a medium bowl, combine <b>ricotta, heavy cream, and 1 clove grated garlic.</b> Season with <b>salt and pepper</b> and set aside.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Prepare the pasta: Heat oven to 425 degrees, and place a large pot of salted water to boil on the stove. Cook <b>pasta</b> until it’s nearly al dente, and drain. Return pasta to pot and add two cups sauce, tossing to make sure the sauce gets in all the nooks and crannies and is nicely coated.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p><i>When assembling, try not to fuss too much over the measurements, but be mindful that you always want to end with a good amount of cheese and sauce on the top to give you a bubbly, browned top.</i></p> <p>Spoon a bit of the remaining sauce in the bottom of a 3 quart baking dish, then add 1/3 of the pasta. Spoon a little sauce on top, then dollop with ricotta, and dot with <b>mozzarella</b>. Grate <b>parmesan</b> on top. Add another 1/3 of the pasta, followed by more sauce, more ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan. Add the rest of the pasta, more sauce, the rest of the ricotta, mozzarella, another good grating of parm, and some pepper (note: there’s a good chance you’ll have some pasta sauce left over– refrigerate or freeze for another time).</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Place the baking dish on a foil-lined sheet pan, and loosely cover the baking dish with foil. Place in the oven and bake for about 20 minutes before removing the foil and continuing to bake until it’s nicely browned and bubbling, another 20-ish minutes. Let cool at least 5 minutes or so before eating—it will stay VERY hot for a while, so don’t worry. </p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p><b>For toasted fennel red sauce:</b> Use 1 fennel bulb in place of half the onion; add 1-2 tsps. fennel seed to toast in the oil before adding tomatoes.</p>
        <p><b>For meaty red sauce:</b> While onion are softening, add 1 lb. ground beef, pork, lamb, turkey or sausage. Season well with salt, pepper (chili flake or fennel seed, if you want), and cook, breaking up the meat with your spoon or spatula until well-browned, 8-10 minutes. Then add tomatoes and cook per the instructions, adding another 20-30 minutes.</p>
        <p><b>Do ahead:</b> Sauce can be made 5 days ahead, refrigerated. It can be frozen for up to 2 months.</p>
        <p>The baked pasta itself can be assembled and baked several days ahead, kept wrapped and refrigerated. To reheat from cold, simply bake per the instructions above. It can also be assembled and frozen up to two months ahead. To reheat from frozen, keep wrapped in foil and bake at 325 degrees until totally defrosted and bubbly (~60 minutes). Remove foil, increase temperature to 425 and bake until golden brown, 20 minutes or so.</p>
